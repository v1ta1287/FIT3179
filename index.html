              The global life expectancy varies drastically around the world,
              even in the modern era. From the map we can see that
              <span class="developed"
                >Europe, North America, Australia and East Asia</span
              >
              have relatively high life expectancies, while
              <span class="undeveloped">Africa and South Asia</span> have
              relatively low life expectancies. We can also see that the range 
              of life expectancy is 60-80 for most countries, although there 
              are some exceptions at both extremes of this range.

              industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
              ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of
              type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
              survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
              electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
              popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
              containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
              publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of
              Lorem Ipsum.
